# smart_farming_solution
### Project: Smart farming solution 

#### Overview
This Arduino-based project monitors gas levels (LPG, CO, Smoke), soil moisture, light intensity, humidity, and temperature using appropriate sensors. Data is displayed on a serial monitor for real-time observation.

#### Features
1. **Gas Detection**: Detects LPG, CO, and smoke levels using MQ-series gas sensors.
2. **Environmental Monitoring**: Measures soil moisture, light intensity, humidity, and temperature.
3. **Calibration**: Automatic calibration of gas sensors for accurate readings.
4. **Feedback Mechanism**: Provides real-time feedback on gas levels and environmental conditions.
5. **Water Supply Control**: Optional control mechanism for water supply based on soil moisture readings.

#### Components
- MQ-series Gas Sensors
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- Arduino Board
- Motor Driver (for optional water supply control)
- Other miscellaneous components (resistors, wires, etc.)

#### Installation
1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect sensors and components as per the provided circuit diagram.
2. **Software Installation**: Upload the provided Arduino sketch using Arduino IDE.
3. **Sensor Calibration**: Optionally, calibrate gas sensors as per the provided instructions.

#### Usage
1. **Power On**: Ensure all connections are secure and power on the system.
2. **Monitoring**: Observe gas levels, soil moisture, light intensity, humidity, and temperature on the serial monitor.
3. **Analysis**: Analyze the data for any abnormalities or trends.
4. **Optional Water Supply Control**: Activate water supply based on soil moisture readings if required.

#### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to suggest improvements, report issues, or submit pull requests to enhance the functionality or accuracy of the system.
